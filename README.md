# MakeNashvilleDoorway

This the arduino sketch that drives the animations of the programmable LEDs around the door way of Make Nashville's lobby.  The code is specific to our particular brand of LED and the geometry of the door.  So the only real use of this code to the world at large is just for programming examples.
